CS 101 project: Controlling the iRobot Create Remotely from a Website using JavaScript

The iRobot Force is a simple web-based remote control to control your iRobot Create. Thank you for your interest in our project.
First, we’ll cover some fundamental assumptions:
•	You have an iRobot Create that is fully integrated with a laptop that has some form of camera
•	You have a Skype account
•	You have a server to host the website
•	You’ve read through “How to Become an iJedi” on the webpage, and have downloaded the receive file onto your camera-enabled laptop
Here’s how to get started:
•	Clone or fork this repository
•	Line 35 of usetheforce.html has our Skype name embedded. Erase this and embed your own Skype name
•	Run the adjusted webpage on your local or public server
•	Change line 19 of reciever.py to link to your server
•	Set up your iRobot as directed on the “How to Become an iJedi” page referenced above, by connecting the laptop and the iRobot, starting the receive program, and beginning the Skype video call
And you’re free to control your iRobot Create from any device!
